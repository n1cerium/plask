# Plask

Plask is a web application where users can add task for specific days. It is only limited to show only within 15 days from the current day. Users can also delete tasks or mark the task as complete, in progress, or ongoing. When adding a task, the users can also add the priority level and when the task will start or end. The app is published through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GS_Connect:+Netlify+Brand&utm_term=netlify)
